1) For our recipe project we should put the automated tests in github actions so that whenever someone from our group pushes code to a branch the tests will run on the pushed code.
2) No
3) Not the whole message feature, but probably just a unit test to make sure that what the user is typing is the messsage that is showing up. Wouldn't necessarily test if the message actually sends correctly.
4) Yes you can totally test the max message length as you can just do simple inputs to see if the max length feature is catching all possible cases and it is a small enough situation as you aren't testing the whole sending message feature
